# spotify
A tool to analyze and save Spotify data.

## Immediate goals
- Save and sync playlists to a Spreadsheet
- Do some basic analysis of playlist data (this will be very specific to my own listening pattern of saving every song to one playlist)
- Ideally analyze play history over a period of time (there are likely a lot of limitations here)

## APIs

Use the https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zmb3/spotify client.
